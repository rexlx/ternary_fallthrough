# ternary_fallthrough:

Due to some push back I want to clarify what it is I'm asking for.

fallthroughs in python.

My ternary example is an attempt to do an example that isn't a "foo" "bar" thing. I wanted to deal with some absract ideas because "hello world" isn't good enough for me.

I also understand that the functional / procedual nature of the code looks a little wierd to OO types. Objects are cool, I dig them. I just like functions.

If the python community doesnt want fallthroughs, thats fine. I'm merely proposing an idea.

The code will run as long as you supply an int, suppling anything else will break the script because the fallthrough statement doesnt actually exist so i cant handle the error in the way im trying to describe.
