# ternary_fallthrough:

Due to some push back I want to clarify what it is I'm asking for.

fallthroughs in python.

My ternary example is an attempt to do an example that isn't a "foo" "bar" thing. I wanted to deal with some absract ideas because "hello world" isn't good enough for me.

I also understand that the functional / procedual nature of the code looks a little wierd to OO types. Objects are cool, I dig them. I just like functions.

If the python community doesnt want fallthroughs, thats fine. I'm merely proposing an idea.
